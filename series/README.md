# Series
`Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, strings, floating point numbers, Python objects, etc.). The axis labels are collectively referred to as the `index`.

The passed `index` is a list of axis labels depending on what data is. [[implementation]](series_intro.py)
